.Peek Documentation
===================

Welcome to the official documentation for .Peek, a Unity editor tool that allows you to automatically generate a report of  the assets included and not into your builds and keep an eye on the evolution of your project assets in a nicely integrated and responsive interface.
We recommend you read the :ref:`introduction page <doc_about_intro>` to get an overview of what this documentation
has to offer.
